# gensdaylit

`gensdaylit.py` is a Python-based alternative to the Radiance `gendaylit` sky generator.  
It models both the spectral composition of daylight and the angular extent of the solar disc, 
providing `.rad` scene files for Radiance simulations.  
This repository includes the initial Python script, sample input files (`.dat`), 
and example output files (`.rad`) to reproduce basic runs.
